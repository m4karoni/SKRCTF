# Welcome to m4karoni SKRCTF write-ups
Hi! This is my first ever write-up for challenges based on my senior's CTF project, [skrctf.me](skrctf.me) which is a ctf site for beginner players.

## Web warmup

Can you find the flag in this website?
Flag format: SKR{flag_flag}
At first, it shows a simple html header and a body:

My first action is to inspect the webpage for the flag:

Just like that, I got the flag!
