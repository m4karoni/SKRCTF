# Welcome to m4karoni SKRCTF write-ups
Hi! This is my first ever write-up for challenges based on my senior's CTF project, [skrctf.me](skrctf.me) which is a ctf site for beginner players.

# Web

## Web warmup

Can you find the flag in this website?
<br />
<br />
Flag format: SKR{flag_flag}
<br />
<br />
"At first, it shows a simple html header and a body:"
<br />
<br />
!["Header and body"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70287409/122788142-9f318380-d2e8-11eb-8f8e-ba98d1f4837a.png)
<br />
<br />
"My first action is to inspect the webpage for the flag:"
<br />
<br />
!["Inpect element"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70287409/122788412-e455b580-d2e8-11eb-89ab-e08f7739cd0d.png)
<br />
<br />
Just like that, I got the flag!

## Where is the flag?
I remember that I put a flag in this website, but I just can't find it. Can you help me?

As hinted in the image, "It's too bright"
